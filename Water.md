### WATER SOURCES

Almost any environment has water present to some degree. Possible sources of water in various environments are listed below. Information on how to make the water potable is provided as well.

**NOTE:** If you do not have a canteen, cup, can, or other type of container, improvise one from plastic or water-resistant cloth. Shape the plastic or cloth into a bowl by pleating it. Use pins or other suitable items—even your hands—to hold the pleats.

* **Frigid areas**
  * **Snow and ice**
    * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Melt and purify.
    * **Remarks:** Do not eat without melting! Eating snow or ice can reduce body temperature and lead to more dehydration.
Snow or ice are no purer than the water from which they come.
Sea ice that is gray in color or opaque is salty. Do not use it without desalting it. Sea ice that is crystalline with a bluish cast has littler salt in it.
* **At sea**
  * **Sea**
    * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Use desalinator.
    * **Remarks:** Do not drink seawater without desalting!
  * **Rain**
    * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Catch rain in tarps or in other water-holding containers.
    * **Remarks:** If tarp or water-holding material is coated with salt, wash it in the sea before using (less salt will remain on it).
  * **Sea ice**
    * **Remarks:** See previous remarks for frigid areas.
* **Beach**
  * **Ground**
    * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Dig hole deep enough to allow water to seep in; obtain rocks, build fire, and heat rocks; drop hot rocks in water; hold cloth over hole to absorb steam; wring water from cloth.
    * **Remarks:** Alternate method if a container or bark pot is available: Fill container or pot with seawater; build fire and boil water to produce steam; hold a cloth over the container to absorb steam; wring water from the cloth.
  * **Fresh**
    * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Dig behind the first group of sand dunes. This will allow the collection of freshwater.
* **Desert**
  * **Sources of water:**
    * In valleys and low areas
    * At foot of concave banks of dry rivers
    * At foot of cliffs or rock outcrops
    * At first depression behind first sand dune of dry lakes
    * Wherever you find damp sand surface sand
    * Wherever you find green vegetation
  * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Dig holes deep enough to allow water to seep in.
  * **Remarks:** In a sand dune belt, any available water will be found beneath the original valley floor at the edge of dunes.
* **Desert (extended)**
  * **Cacti**
    * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Cut off the top of a barrel cactus and mash or squeeze the pulp.
**CAUTION: Do not eat pulp. Place pulp in mouth, suck out juice, and discard pulp.**
    * **Remarks:** Without a machete, cutting into a cactus is difficult and takes time since you must get past the long, strong spines and cut through the tough rind.
  * **Depressions or holes in rocks**
    * **Remarks:** Periodic rainfall may collect in pools, seep into fissures, or collect in holes in rocks.
  * **Fissures in rock**
    * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Insert flexible tubing and siphon water. If fissure is large enough, you can lower a container into it.
  * **Porous rock**
    * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Insert flexible tubing and siphon water.
  * **Condensation on metal**
    * **Means of obtaining and/or making potable:** Use cloth to absorb water, then wring water from cloth.
    * **Remarks:** Extreme temperature variations between night and day may cause condensation on metal surfaces. Following are signs to watch for in the desert to help you find water:
      * All trails lead to water. You should follow in the direction in which the trails converge. Signs of camps, campfire ashes, animal droppings, and trampled terrain may mark trails.
      * Flocks of birds will circle over water holes. Some birds fly to water holes at dawn and sunset. Their flight at these times is usually fast and close to the ground. Bird tracks or chirping sounds in the evening or early morning sometimes indicate that water is nearby.

If you do not have a reliable source to replenish your water supply, stay alert for ways in which your environment can help you.
